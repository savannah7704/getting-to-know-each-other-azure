<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"><h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><p style="text-align: center"><p margin= ></p>My name is Savannah Stumpf. I'm a freshman here at Lewis and I 
live with my parents, younger sister, and my dog named Gibbs. I work as a server at an assisted living facility and when I'm not
at school or work I enjoy spending time with my family, drawing, and playing video games. I'm majoring in computer science
and I have not decided on a minor yet. I'm majoring in computer science because it's very intriguing and I have an interest
in working on video games in the future.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"><h2 style="text-align: center">What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;"></ul>
<li>Different programming languages</li>
<li>Git and Github</li>
<li>Networks</li>
<li>How software and hardware interact</li>
<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"><h2 style="text-align: center">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><p style="text-align: center">My favorite hobby is playing video games. I like lots of games but my
favorites are The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Tomb Raider. I've been a gamer ever since I was very little and video games have
had a big impact on me. Not only do I have fun playing them, but I also appreciate how they can tell amazing stories and take the player
on grand adventures while also being more interactive than a book or a movie. I'm also very interested in how they are made which is
why I took a game design class in high school.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"><h2 style="text-align: center">Fun Fact</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia;"><p style="text-align: center">A fun fact about me is that I draw fictional characters. I like to draw
characters from games and movies but I also make up my own.</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"><h2 style="text-align: center">Greatest Innovation</h2>

    <li><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine">Analytical Engine</a> The analytical engine was designed by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace contributed to it by writing
        what is considered to be the first computer program. The analytical engine introduced concepts like a CPU and memory.
        Although it was never actually built, it paved the way for computers in the future.

    <li><a href= "https://codedocs.org/what-is/z3-computer"> Z3 Computer</a> The Z3 was created by Konrad Zuse in 1941. It was the
